# Stock Stalk Example and HTML Template

This is a practical example of my idea for a modern general HTML Template for 2018.

By the way, @zachberry:

Start with index.html and work your way down through the styles and scripts. If there's anything of note that has to do with ES6, ES7, or anything that wouldn't normally work in IE11, there should be a corresponding .documentation.md file. 

I'll try to link to them all here, once I push this up.
