# Custom Elements

* [Google Custom Elements v1: Reusable Web Components](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements)

## Example

Custom elements can be used before their definition is registered.

Progressive enhancement is a feature of custom elements. In other words, you can declare a bunch of <app-drawer> elements on the page and never invoke customElements.define('app-drawer', ...) until much later. This is because the browser treats potential custom elements differently thanks to unknown tags. The process of calling define() and endowing an existing element with a class definition is called "element upgrades".

To know when a tag name becomes defined, you can use window.customElements.whenDefined(). It vends a Promise that resolves when the element becomes defined.

```js
customElements.whenDefined('app-drawer').then(() => {
  console.log('app-drawer defined');
});
```

Delay work until a set of child elements are upgraded (pre-loading A/B Tests, for example).

```js
<share-buttons>
  <social-button type="twitter"><a href="...">Twitter</a></social-button>
  <social-button type="fb"><a href="...">Facebook</a></social-button>
  <social-button type="plus"><a href="...">G+</a></social-button>
</share-buttons>

// Fetch all the children of <share-buttons> that are not defined yet.
let undefinedButtons = buttons.querySelectorAll(':not(:defined)');

let promises = [...undefinedButtons].map(socialButton => {
  return customElements.whenDefined(socialButton.localName);
));

// Wait for all the social-buttons to be upgraded.
Promise.all(promises).then(() => {
  // All social-button children are ready.
});
```


## Available Lifecycle Functions

These are pretty equivalent to React lifecycle callbacks.

<div class="devsite-table-wrapper"><table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Called when</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>constructor</span></code></td>
      <td>An instance of the element is
        created or <a href="#upgrades">upgraded</a>. Useful for initializing
        state, settings up event listeners, or
        <a href="#shadowdom">creating shadow dom</a>.
        See the
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-element-conformance">
        spec
        </a>
        for restrictions on what you can do in the <code><span>constructor</span></code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>connectedCallback</span></code></td>
      <td>Called every time the
        element is inserted into the DOM. Useful for running setup code, such as
        fetching resources or rendering. Generally, you should try to delay work
        until this time.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>disconnectedCallback</span></code></td>
      <td>Called every time the element is removed from the DOM. Useful for
        running clean up code.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>attributeChangedCallback(<wbr>attrName,<wbr> oldVal,<wbr> newVal)</span></code></td>
      <td>Called when an <a href="#attrchanges">observed attribute</a> has been
        added, removed, updated, or replaced. Also called for initial values
        when an element is created by the parser, or
        <a href="#upgrades">upgraded</a>. <b>Note:</b> only
        attributes listed in the <code><span>observedAttributes</span></code> property will
        receive this callback.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>adoptedCallback()</span></code></td>
      <td>The
        custom element has been moved into a new <code><span>document</span></code> (e.g.
        someone called <code><span>document.<wbr>adoptNode(<wbr>el)</span></code>).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table></div>
