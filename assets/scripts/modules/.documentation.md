## Available Lifecycle Functions

These are pretty equivalent to 

<div class="devsite-table-wrapper"><table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Called when</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>constructor</span></code></td>
      <td>An instance of the element is
        created or <a href="#upgrades">upgraded</a>. Useful for initializing
        state, settings up event listeners, or
        <a href="#shadowdom">creating shadow dom</a>.
        See the
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-element-conformance">
        spec
        </a>
        for restrictions on what you can do in the <code><span>constructor</span></code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>connectedCallback</span></code></td>
      <td>Called every time the
        element is inserted into the DOM. Useful for running setup code, such as
        fetching resources or rendering. Generally, you should try to delay work
        until this time.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>disconnectedCallback</span></code></td>
      <td>Called every time the element is removed from the DOM. Useful for
        running clean up code.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>attributeChangedCallback(<wbr>attrName,<wbr> oldVal,<wbr> newVal)</span></code></td>
      <td>Called when an <a href="#attrchanges">observed attribute</a> has been
        added, removed, updated, or replaced. Also called for initial values
        when an element is created by the parser, or
        <a href="#upgrades">upgraded</a>. <b>Note:</b> only
        attributes listed in the <code><span>observedAttributes</span></code> property will
        receive this callback.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><span>adoptedCallback()</span></code></td>
      <td>The
        custom element has been moved into a new <code><span>document</span></code> (e.g.
        someone called <code><span>document.<wbr>adoptNode(<wbr>el)</span></code>).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
